Each enforcer has only one bundle stored locally at any one time, and it contains all the information it requires for all policies currently deployed to it. Every heartbeat interval, each enforcer contacts the CloudAz inquiring if there are any new or updated policies that should be deployed to that enforcer; if there are, the CloudAz sends a new bundle that overwrites the one currently deployed there."},{"type":"entry","name":"policy component","value":"See components."},{"type":"entry","name":"Policy Decision Point (PDP)","value":"The entity that evaluates applicable policies and computes authorization decisions. CloudAz comes with a preconfigured set of PDPs (Policy Decision Points), which supports standards-based interaction REST APIs to make authorization requests. The PDPs evaluate deployed authorization policies at runtime against incoming requests, and return authorization decisions to PEPs (Policy Enforcement Points)."},{"type":"entry","name":"Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)","value":"The software component that performs access control by making authorization requests to PDPs (Policy Decision Points) and enforcing decisions."},{"type":"entry","name":"Policy Information Point (PIP)","value":"The component that is the source of user, resource, and environment attributes. A PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) or PDP (Policy Decision Point) interacts with the PIP to obtain attributes. In an enterprise deployment, a typical PIP would be an LDAP server, HR database, or other data repository with license keys."},{"type":"entry","name":"policy modeling","value":"The process of defining the metadata to represent actors (Subjects) requesting authorization for a given set of objects (Resources)."},{"type":"entry","name":"policy object","value":"A generic term sometimes used to refer to policies and policy components."},{"type":"entry","name":"report query","value":"The group of filter settings available in the Reporter console that control how report content is extracted from the Activity Journal."},{"type":"entry","name":"Report Server","value":"A major component of CloudAz that is responsible for storing, managing, and serving data on end-user activity and policy enforcement.
